# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard

Project's Objective: To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

The Steps that i covered during projects:

1. Define Key Performance Metrics (KPIs)

Identify the critical metrics you want to track. Some common KPIs for a credit card dashboard might include:
Transaction Volume: Number of transactions processed.
Transaction Value: Total value of transactions.
Active Cards: Number of active credit cards.
Customer Spend Analysis: Average spend per customer, customer segmentation.
Fraud Detection Metrics: Number of flagged transactions, confirmed fraud cases.
Approval Rates: Approval vs. rejection rates for new applications.
Delinquency Rates: Percentage of overdue payments.
Revenue Metrics: Interest income, fee income.

2. Data Collection and Integration
Data Sources: Collect data from various sources like transaction databases, CRM systems, and fraud detection systems.
Data Integration: Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to gather and unify data. Ensure data is cleansed and transformed into a usable format.

3. Data Modeling
Data Warehouse: Set up a data warehouse to store and manage data efficiently.
Data Modeling: Create relational or dimensional data models to represent the data structure. Define relationships between different data entities.

4. Dashboard Design
Visualization Tools: Use tools like Power BI to create interactive and user-friendly dashboards.
Dashboard Layout: Plan the layout to display KPIs, charts, and graphs effectively. Consider using cards for summary stats, line charts for trends, pie charts for segmentation, and tables for detailed data.
Real-Time Insights: Ensure the dashboard can update in near real-time or at least refresh frequently to provide the latest data.

5. DAX and Advanced Analytics
DAX Calculations: Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for complex calculations and aggregations. This can include time intelligence functions, custom metrics, and advanced analytics.
Predictive Analytics: Implement machine learning models for predictive insights, like forecasting trends or identifying potential fraud.

6. Testing and Validation
Accuracy Check: Ensure data accuracy and integrity by comparing dashboard metrics with raw data.
Usability Testing: Test the dashboard's usability with stakeholders to ensure it meets their needs and is easy to navigate.

7. Deployment and Monitoring
Deployment: Deploy the dashboard to a platform accessible to stakeholders. Configure permissions and access controls.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Monitor the dashboard's performance, update it with new data or metrics as needed, and maintain data connections.

8. Documentation and Training
User Guide: Create documentation to help users understand and utilize the dashboard effectively.
Training Sessions: Conduct training sessions for stakeholders to explain the dashboard's features and functionalities.

Implementation Steps Using Power BI:

Connect Data Sources: Import data into Power BI from databases, Excel files, or other sources.
Create Data Model: Define relationships and create calculated columns/measures using DAX.
Build Visuals: Use Power BI's visualization tools to create charts, tables, and other visuals.
Design Dashboard: Arrange visuals on the dashboard canvas, ensuring a clear and intuitive layout.
Set Up Refresh Schedule: Configure data refresh to keep the dashboard updated with the latest data.
Share and Collaborate: Share the dashboard with stakeholders and set up permissions.
